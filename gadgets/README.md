# gadgets

Package gadgets are special collections of widgets

Things to avoid or keep in mind: Also Features these might enable:

```go
* These should never bypass the binary tree
* Hide complexity internally here
* These might require corresponding toolkit implementations?
* These might allow unique/good corresponding toolkit implementations (date/time selection?)

## Warning

Doing this / adding these might be a really bad idea that I will regret later
